Our overall goal is to develop and validate disturbance and connectivity maps at a regional scale for a pilot planning region in southeast Yukon and northwest BC that could be used for conservation and land use planning. This intent of this workbook is to serve as a detailed record to regional scale disturbance and connectivity mapping and monitoring. The project is divided into three related components, each with its own set of objectives: Spatial database - Develop a multi-scale spatial database using national and regional scale datasets for use in regional disturbance and connectivity mapping and analysis. Disturbance mapping - Develop individual and cumulative disturbance maps - Develop value-added products such as human footprint and intactness maps - Validate and enhance map products using remote sensing and field based data Connectivity mapping - Assess current state of ecological connectivity - Evaluate projected effects of climate and land use change "]]
