# Disturbance and Connectivity Mapping

Updated: January 11, 2022

Conserving wilderness and intact areas is a top priority for conservation in the boreal region, and cumulative disturbance and ecological connectivity maps are practical ways to identify such areas. Our overall goal is to develop and validate disturbance and connectivity maps at a regional scale for a pilot planning region in southeast Yukon and northwest BC that could be used for conservation and land use planning.

The project is divided into three related components:

**Spatial database**

- Objectives:
    - Develop spatial database using national and regional scale datasets
- Appendices
    - [Study region FDAs](docs/database_region.csv)
    - [Yukon datasets](docs/database_yukon.csv)
    - [Canada datasets](docs/database_canada.csv)

**Disturbance mapping**

- Objectives:
    - Develop individual and cumulative disturbance maps
    - Develop value-added products such as human footprint and intactness maps
    - Validate and enhance map products using remote sensing and field based data
- Appendices:
    - [Footprint datasets](docs/disturbance_footprint.csv)
    - [Disturbance types](docs/disturbance_types.csv) - Description of disturbance types organized by feature type (areal or linear) and industry type. The table was adapted from the recently published document prepared by Kate Powell with the Fish and Wildlife Branch, Environment Yukon ("SurfaceDisturbance_MappingStandards_forContractors_v4-0-1.pdf").

**Connectivity mapping**

- Objectives:
    - Assess current state of ecological connectivity
    - Evaluate projected effects of climate and land use change
- Appendices:
    - [Features to connect](docs/connectivity_features.csv) - Candidate features for connectivity mapping and analysis.
    - [Home range sizes and dispersal distances](docs/connectivity_dispersal.csv) - Home range sizes and dispersal distances for selected species.
