However, available global assessments of wilderness and intact areas are generally too coarse or exclude local disturbance types (Vernier et al. 2021, Preprint), and consequently are not very useful for regional conservation and land use decisions. Our overall goal is to develop and validate a regional scale cumulative disturbance map for a pilot planning region in southeast Yukon and northwest BC that could be used for conservation and land use planning. Specifically, our objectives are to: Develop individual and cumulative disturbance maps Develop value-added products such as human footprint and intactness maps Validate and enhance map products using remote sensing and field based data 3.1 Develop disturbance maps 3.1.1 Develop individual disturbance type maps Activities: Some disturbance types may not need further processing; others will need to be combined spatially, for example when combining data from Yukon and BC or between tenure holders Combine similar disturbance type maps Upload combined disturbance type maps to University of Alberta server Products: Individual disturbance maps comprising individual or multiple datasets Code and documentation to enable replication 3.1.2 Develop cumulative disturbance maps Activities: Review methods for combining individual disturbance maps in cumulative disturbances maps Examples include: ABMI, BEAD Develop a detailed algorithm for combining individual datasets into: Cumulative map of linear disturbances (vector) Cumulative map of polygonal disturbances (vector) Combine linear and polygonal disturbance maps into a single cumulative disturbance map Add a small buffer around linear disturbances Create a raster version of the cumulative disturbance map Save all code, metadata, and documentation to GitHub Upload cumulative disturbance maps to University of Alberta server Products Database that includes: Vector linear and polygonal disturbances Combined vector and raster cumulative disturbance maps Code and documentation to enable replication 3.2 Develop value added products The focus of this component is to develop value-added products from the individual and cumulative map products. Initially, we will focus on two: a regional scale human footprint map and a regional scale landscape intactness map. More than one map of each type can be developed depending on assumptions e.g., the size of zones of influence buffers. 3.2.1 Create human footprint maps (optional) The human footprint map takes individual disturbance layers and applies buffers and weights to create a final map showing human pressures ranging from 0 to some maximum which depends on the area and the input maps. Apply the human footprint methodology developed by Sanderson (1996) and revised by Venter et al. (2016) to create a regional human footprint map Apply and code original method Develop a tool that enables users to modify the input parameters used to create the human footprint map i.e., buffer sizes and weights (pressure scores) Products: Regional footprint maps using original and modified methods Tool enabling user to create their own human footprint map 3.2.2 Create intactness maps Intactness maps can be created from i) the cumulative disturbance maps i.e., areas with no disturbances, ii) the cumulative disturbance map with human influence buffers added, or iii) the human footprint map. The minimum size (and shape) of intact areas can also be specified as an additional parameter. Activities: Develop code to create custom intactness map based on user defined criteria for buffer sizes (if any) and weights (if any) Products: Example intactness map(s) Tool for creating intactness map(s) from input individual disturbance maps or cumulative disturbance map 3.3 Validate and enhance map products The focus of this component is on developing and implementing a strategy for validating disturbance and intactness maps. 3.3.1 Fill in gaps in coverage Activities: Evaluate completeness of datasets for each identified disturbance type. Identify gaps in spatial and temporal coverage Assess whether gaps can be filled with detailed disturbance mapping Mapping using recent high resolution satellite imagery Digitizing from recent air photos Drone footage Fill in gaps in spatial and temporal coverage (long-term objective) Prioritize gaps Identify collaborators (Liard First Nation, citizen scientists, researchers) with requisite experience to validate and map disturbances Interpret satellite imagery Interpret (classify) and map (digitize) disturbances from air photos Combine newly create maps with existing disturbance type maps (unless its a unique disturbance map) Document procedures for mapping disturbances to fill in gaps Products: Procedure manual (tutorial) for disturbance mapping using satellite imagery and air photos Disturbance maps for the gaps in coverage (stand alone and combined with existing maps) 3.3.2 Remote-based validation Activities: Use high-resolution satellite imagery to validate accuracy of final cumulative disturbance maps Design validation plan (Satellite-based) Select validation data source (Google Earth Engine, ESRI World Imagery) Evaluate different strategies (e.g., random, stratified random, systematic sampling) in terms of power and precison. How many plots do we need to have a desired level of precision? Define criteria for inclusion or rejection of individual plots. Develop a standardized key to visually interpret the individual disturbances Visually identify disturbances within 5,000, 1-km2 randomly located sample plots Estimate type and area of disturbances Quantify the level of agreement between the disturbance maps and the validation dataset (RMSE, Cohens kappa) Prepare document in tutorial format for validating disturbance maps using satellite imagery Products: Statistical validation of disturbance maps Tutorial on validating disturbance maps using Google Earth Engine or similar framework 3.3.3 Field-based validation Activities: Design validation plan (field-based) Evaluate different strategies (e.g., random, stratified random, systematic sampling) in terms of power and precision Undertake field work based on validation plan Products: Statistical validation of disturbance maps Field-based validation procedure manual 3.3.4 Long term disturbance monitoring The focus of this component is to develop a program and procedure for continuous remote and field monitoring of anthropogenic disturbances in the study region. Activities: Collaborate with existing initiative involved in regional remote or field based monitoring term citizen-science e.g., Indigenous Guardians, ENGOs, etc. This component needs to be developed further Using GEE and other data sources Products: Monitoring plan "],["connectivity-mapping.html", "Chapter 4 Connectivity Mapping 4.1 Assess current state of ecological connectivity 4.2 Evaluate projected effects of climate and land use change", " Chapter 4 Connectivity Mapping General tasks to discuss and integrate under the objectives below: Engage partners / collaborators Organize and implement scoping / planning workshops 4.1 Assess current state of ecological connectivity 4.1.1 Protected and conserved area connectivity The overall goal is to evaluate the connectivity of existing and/or proposed PCA networks.  The features of interest are PCAs and the PCA networks, but some species-level information is also needed to run the analysis i.e., dispersal distance of generic species. The permeability of the matrix also needs to be taken into consideration.  Specific objectives include: Evaluate the ecological connectivity of existing and proposed PCA networks Quantify and rank the contribution of individual existing or proposed sites (PAs, IPCAs, BAs) to network connectivity (this includes extensions to existing PCAs) Assess the sensitivity of network connectivity to assumptions about dispersal capability and matrix permeability Identify and prioritize areas of high landscape integrity between PCAs that can serve as corridors or stepping stones (climate change) Develop a shiny app to visualize the effects of i) adding/removing individual PCAs and ii) changing assumptions about dispersal/permeability on network connectivity Datasets: Intactness layer - to be developed in conjunction with the Disturbance Mapping project.

Species-level information could be used if we assume that certain habitat types could be linked to species, in which case we could use dispersal distances to measure effective distance between patches. The permeability of the matrix also needs to be taken into consideration. Specific objectives include: Evaluate landscape connectivity Evaluate connectivity of specific habitat (ecosystem) types Datasets: Datasets required to develop disturbance/intactness maps Canadian human footprint (300m) National linear disturbances (seismic lines and roads) ACTION ITEM: acquire linear disturbances from Lucy Poley Wildfire and forest harvest maps for 1985-2015 (30m) from Satellite Forest Information for Canada Regional disturbance map for SE Yukon and NE BC (future) ACTION ITEM: connect with BEACONs disturbance mapping project Habitat types NALC 2015 (30m) High-resolution annual forest land cover maps for Canadas forested ecosystems (1984-2019) Tools: Circuitscape (Omniscape); Appropriate for 1) multiple species, 2) no clear binary nodes, 3) more intact landscapes, and 4) widespread/ranging generalist species Linkage Mapper (more suited to identifying specific corridors between IPCAs) References: TNC - Resilient and Connected Landscapes (Anderson et al. 2016) Tasks: Identify important habitat and ecosystem types ACTION ITEM: which are important in our region? Develop resistance grid comprising intactness and land cover Map connectivity using Circuitscape. TNC report details this approach and a novel Circuitscape analysis to get flow across a large landscape. Flow can then be used as an input to other connectivity analyses (e.g. prioritising riparian areas). 4.1.3 Aquatic ecosystem connectivity The overall goal is to evaluate aquatic connectivity as a system or its individual components:  i) wetland connectivity, ii) riparian connectivity, iii) lotic connectivity. Datasets: Wetlands ACTION ITEM: Ask Kim about wetland products in SE Yukon (DUCs?) 1:50,000 LED map Riparian ACTION ITEM: Are there any maps in Yukon of riparian areas. Often mapped as potential riparian habitat based on stream data and DEMs. Lotic Stream network Tools: Wetlands Circuitscape between wetlands. Could use LED to make a resistance surface. Riparian TNC/Krosby 2018 analysis (requires mapped riparian areas) methods to rank riparian areas Lotic Dendritic connectivity index References: Riparian corridors TNC - Resilient and Connected Landscapes Krosby 2018 - Identifying riparian climate corridors to inform climate adaptation planning Tasks: Develop methods for assessing wetland connectivity. This could be a similar analysis to Terrestrial ecosystem connectivity above. Develop methods for assessing riparian connectivity. General approach for riparian corridors is to map potential riparian areas then rank them based on connectivity flow, intactness, size, temperature gradients, tree cover etc. Creating our own riparian areas map would be possible but probably quite a lot of work. Develop methods for assessing lotic connectivity. Dendritic connectivity within reserves or areas of interest (i.e. corridors). 4.1.4 Focal species habitat connectivity The overall goal is to evaluate connectivity for i) culturally significant species, ii) species at risk and iii) indicator species e.g.,  surrogates, umbrella, and ecosystem engineers. Developing resistance surfaces for individual species will be a key component. Specific objectives include: Evaluate ecological connectivity for selected culturally significant species Evaluate ecological connectivity for species at risk Evaluate ecological connectivity for indicator species Datasets: Datasets to develop species-specific resistance surfaces Existing predicted species distribution maps Input datasets that can be used to created predicted species distribution maps from existing SDM or RSF models Tools: Circuitscape (Omniscape) GrapHab References: Tasks: Select focal species with LFN and other collaborators and partners Identify and acquire species distribution models for selected focal species Peer reviewed literature and published reports Indigenous knowledge Develop species-specifi intactness/disturbance maps and quantify resistance values for focal species 4.1.5 Bio-cultural connectivity The focus here could be on something like using land use and occupancy maps, or culturally important sites, creating a heat map from this and overlaying.. perhaps.. prelim idea. Such maps -have- been created for TH and NND to an extent, but would require data sharing agreements. From Beazley et al. 2021 on Transboundary Connectivity Conservation: Bison, caribou, and other such species are biocultural keystones, important to Indigenous food, lifeways, spirituality, and other reciprocal cultural and stewardship responsibilities and land-based systems and practices. Note: One consideration Ive been grappling with is if FN knowledge is part of a process, how is the process helping continually regenerate/enforce that knowledge system? The science systems we use, in ways, reinforce themselves by their very nature (need to go out and monitor, need expertise that requires training in sciences). Maybe beyond all this but something to keep in mind. Datasets: Land Use and Occupancy maps which may include but limited to: trails, sites of cultural importance, sites of harvest Seems some of this knowledge is out there, unsure where. Could use cultural species information to create mapping products from a traditional ecological knowledge perspective, as Jean Polfus and Round River have done with TRT. Cultural beliefs about the land - been considering how to do this, and think its more of a framing problem in ways, for example - there is some animism attributed to the land and animals in some Kaska knowledge, this can be integrated into the way science is communicated and what options may or may not be possible through science. YESAB Submissions may have some of this, public documents also. Tools: The land use and occupancy maps could be folded into a spatial analysis, some values could be critical, ie. cultural keystone places. Nvivo? - Excel could serve this purpose in ways too. References: Tasks: Important habitat and species should arise from community working with, some of this could be gathered from existing documents. This could be a thought piece development, where biocultural information is informing parts of the process. Potential task could be review of publicly available knowledge in an area I am currently considering a Qualitative Content Analysis methodology. 4.2 Evaluate projected effects of climate and land use change 4.2.1 Effects of land use activities on connectivity The overall goal is to evaluate past, present, and future changes in land use and land cover on ecological connectivity. Features to be connected can be selected from the ones used for the other objectives. The permeability/resistance of the surface is another key component that also has overlap with the previous objectives. Specific objectives include: Evaluate the effects of recent changes (~30 years) in land use / land cover on connectivity Evaluate the effects of proposed land use activities on connectivity e.g., proposed road or mine Evaluate the effect of simulated land cover changes on connectivity Datasets: Multi-year land cover dataset (e.g., ESA 1986-2015) Disturbance/intactness maps for past and present Tools: To be determined (see Tasks) References: Tasks: Assess changes in land cover during the past 30 years Use CEC land cover data to quantify changes in natural and anthropogenic land cover classes. Evaluate effects of proposed land use activities Identify proposed land use activities of concern e.g., mining and/or roads. Use methods developed above to evaluate impacts of proposed activities on ecological connectivity i.e., CPA/terrestrial/aquative connectivity. Develop tool to evaluate proposed or simulated land use change Three possible approaches: i) adapt CONSERV, ii) develop SPADES module, or iii) develop standalone R/Shiny app. 4.2.2 Effects of climate change on connectivity The overall goal is to evaluate the potential effects of climate change scenarios on ecological connectivity and to develop methods for incorporating climate-resilient design into BEACONs conservation planning approach. Specific objectives include: Identify and prioritize areas of high landscape integity between PCAs that can serve as corridors or stepping stones (also listed under Protected and Conserved Area Connectivity) Identify corridors that follow temperature and precipitation gradients that may assist individuals tracking suitable climates Identify areas that are expected to remain climatically suitable (stable) for individual species over a given planning horizon Identify areas that provide dispersal pathways between stable habitat and locations that will be climatically suitable in the future Datasets: Existing North America wide climate analogs, refugia, and velocity datasets from AdaptWest. Intactness map (combination of existing maps or new map (see disturbance mapping project) Tools: Circuitscape References: Parks et al. 2020, Dobrowski et al. 2021 Tasks: Define planning region and baseline and projected time periods for analyses. Evaluate usefulness of existing baseline and projected datasets for regional connectivity planning (criteria: resolution, range of variability). If desired, develop regional-scale climate change datasets Acquire information on methods for creating regional datasets Evaluate feasibility of creating regional datasets Develop regional-scale datasets Create multi-temporal database with common extent, resolution, and projection. Obj 1: Identify and prioritize high intactness areas e.g., corridors, stepping stones See detailed methods under Protected and Conserved Area Connectivity Obj 2: Identify corridors that follow temperature and precipitation gradients Methods to be developed Obj 3: Identify areas that are expected to remain climatically suitable Select focal species (see Focal Species Habitat Connectivity) Acquire or develop SDM for selected focal species Can also evaluate general suitability using refugia datasets from Adaptwest Develop methods to evaluate connectivity (e.g., Dobrowski et al. 2021) Obj 4: Identify areas that provide dispersal pathways Use same focal species and SDMs as above Develop methods to evaluate connectivity (e.g., Dobrowski et al. 2021) Develop and implement methods for quantifying the effects of uncertainty in existing and projected datasets.

Feature.type Industry.type Disturbance.type Description Areal Agriculture Agriculture Farms, ranches, or other agricultural areas Forestry Forestry Cut blocks or other forestry related activities Mining Building A building footprint or the building and the surrounding land related to mining activities Drill Pad Drill pad features related to mineral exploration activities Fuel Cache Remote caches of fuel allowing for mineral exploration activities (will often have fuel tanks and barrels) Gravel Pit / Quarry Pit or quarry for mining gravel or aggregate Laydown area Areas used to store materials and equipment for mining operations Mining Miscellaneous or unknown mining activities Placer Mining - Minor Placer mining area with little disturbance Place Mining - Significant Placer mining area with greater disturbance Quartz Mining - Minor Quartz mining area with little disturbance Quarts Mining - Significant Quartz mining area with greater disturbance Tailing Pond Tailing pond associated with mining activity Camp Mining camp Oil and Gas Well Pad Cleared area surrounding oil or gas well Rural Camp Any camp outside of mining areas, including fishing/hunting camps, ENV conservation officer cabins/camps, outfitters, etc. Homestead Rural dwelling and associated land Transportation Airstrip Airport or Airstrip Clearing Clearings that are related to transportation but could not be clearly attributed as a turn area, pullout, road cut and fill, etc. Gravel Pit / Quarry Gravel pits related to transportation Pullout / Turn Area An area associated with transportation and is intended as a vehicle pullout or turn area Road Cut and Fill Cut slopes and moved earth for road construction purposes Unknown Clearing A tract of land devoid (or nearly devoid) of natural land cover and suspected to be anthropogenic in nature Gravel Pit / Quarry A gravel pit with unknown related industry Unknown Unable to identify from imagery, but suspected to be anthropogenic Urban Building Visible building or structure Cemetery Cemetery Clearing Miscellaneous urban clearings Cul-de-sac / Turn Area A turn area associated with transportation or road cul-de-sac Dam Barrier impounding water or stream Golf Course Recreational golfing area Industrial Areas that are designated for industrial uses: factories, tank farm, transportation area Institutional Any institutional buildings and immediate cleared area: School, government, etc. Landfill Site used for disposal of waste materials Pond Standing body of water, created anthropogenically; includes sewage lagoons, wastewater facilities, and artificial bodies of water Recreation Area Visible disturbance in Urban / Rural parks and recreation areas Rural Residential Land use in which housing predominates in an urban or community setting Tower A tall structure, possibly used for communications or forestry Urban Miscellaneous or unknown urban features Linear Mining Survey / Cutline A linear cleared area through undeveloped land, used for line-of-sight surveying; impossible to distinguish whether associated with quartz or placer mining (overlapping or unclear claims information) Survey / Cutline - Placer A linear cleared area through undeveloped land, used for line-of-sight surveying; associated with placer mining (identified using claims information and/or other indicators) Survey / Cutline - Quartz A linear cleared area through undeveloped land, used for line-of-sight surveying; associated with quartz mining (identified using claims information and/or other indicators) Trench A long, narrow excavation dug to expose vein or ore structure Unknown Unknown linear mining disturbance Oil and Gas Pipeline Visible pipeline or pipeline Right-of-Way (above- or below-ground) Seismic Line Seismic lines Rural Driveway A driveway in a rural area Fence A fence in a rural area Transportation Access Assumed A linear feature that is assumed to be an access road, but could also be a trail Access Road A road or narrow passage whose primary function is to provide access for resource extraction (i.e. mining, forestry) and may also have served in providing public access to the backcountry Arterial Road A major thoroughfare with medium to large traffic capacity Local Road A low-speed thoroughfare, provides access to front of properties, including those with potential public restrictions such as trailer parks, First Nations land, private estate, seasonal residences, gravel pits (NRN definition for Local Street/Local Strata/Local Unknown). Shows signs of regular use. Right of Way For Road Rights as attributed in the land parcels ancillary data Trail Path or track (typically &lt;1.5 m wide) used for walking, cycling, ORV, or other backcountry activities. (Note: trails used for mining activities are Access Roads.) Unpaved Road Dirt or gravel road (typically &gt;1.5 m wide) that does not necessarily access remote resources Unknown Right of Way A right of way with unknown industry type Survey / Cutline A linear cleared area through undeveloped land, used for line-of-sight surveying. A cutline may not always be associated with mineral exploration, therefore, Type: Unknown was used to differentiate all cutlines that were outside of mineral exploration. Unknown Unclassified, or unable to identify type based on imagery, but suspected to be anthropogenic Utility Electric Utility Corridor Corridor usually running parallel to highway, where transmission lines or other utilities are visible Unknown Unknown linear feature assumed to be a utility corridor; ancillary data is unclear "],["appendix-3---connectivity-mapping.html", "Appendix 3 - Connectivity mapping Features to connect Home range sizes and dispersal distances", " Appendix 3 - Connectivity mapping Features to connect Table 1.
